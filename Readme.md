## Simple Blockchain

This is a simple example at a blockchain. It uses SHA512 hashing, and writes the results to a file called "chain". All you need is a C++ compiler; there are no special dependencies.

This is not 100% my original work. Although I rewrote and switched the SHA hashing, the original idea came from here: [https://davenash.com/2017/10/build-a-blockchain-with-c/](https://davenash.com/2017/10/build-a-blockchain-with-c/)
